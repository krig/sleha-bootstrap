HA Cluster Bootstrap
====================

NOTE: The actual implementation of these tools has moved to crmsh:

    https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh

Tools to bootstrap a Pacemaker High Availability cluster in a hurry.

* ha-cluster-init
  Installs and configures the first node in a new cluster.

* ha-cluster-join
  Installs and configures new nodes to join the cluster.

* ha-cluster-remove
  Removes a node from the cluster.

* ha-cluster-geo-init
  Configure cluster as the initial cluster in a geo configuration.

* ha-cluster-geo-join
  Add cluster to a geo configuration.

* ha-cluster-geo-init-arbitrator
  Configure node as geo arbitrator.

NOTE: This tool is most likely to work best on a SUSE-based 
distribution (SLE or openSUSE). Patches to make it cross-
platform compatible are welcomed.
